Description: Kasumi is a method for the identification of spatially localized 
    neighborhoods of intra- and intercellular relationships, persistent across 
    samples and conditions. Kasumi learns compressed explainable representations 
    of spatial omics samples while preserving relevant biological signals that are 
    readily deployable for data exploration and hypothesis generation, facilitating 
    translational tasks.
